# About
> Writing about Swift and iOS. I hope it will help others and help myself.

## Me
My name is Mike Gopsill. I am an iOS developer from Essex, United Kingdom. Iâ€™ve been in the tech industry since 2014. I started coding Swift professionally in 2017. My studies were largely irrelevant to my career ðŸ˜‚.

Currently Senior iOS Engineer at [Ford Mobility](https://www.ford.com/mobility.html), working on [â€ŽFordPass](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fordpass/id1095418609) and [â€ŽFordPass Pro](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/fordpass-pro/id1471369674).
Also develop the free [P:E Ratio Diet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/p-e-ratio/id1486639935) app.
